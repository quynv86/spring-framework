#  It is important to know that by convention, you must use a bootstrap.yml file in your client
#  because your main configuration now resides in the Git repository or any storage you used to centralize your configuration.
#  From now on, we are going to use YAML files, which offer a simple hierarchy and are easy to read.
#  Beware, though, that you need to have a least two-space indentations for any new property
